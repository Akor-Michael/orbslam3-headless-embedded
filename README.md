# Headless ORB-SLAM3 for Embedded Deployment

**Code Release Coming September 2025**

Production-ready headless implementation of ORB-SLAM3 designed for embedded systems deployment without visualization dependencies. This repository provides the first working headless ORB-SLAM3 solution for ARM and FPGA platforms.

## Overview

This headless ORB-SLAM3 implementation was developed as part of our research on embedded SLAM acceleration, addressing the critical need for visualization-free ORB-SLAM3 deployment on resource-constrained platforms.

**Problem Solved:** Existing headless ORB-SLAM3 solutions (such as ran5515) are non-functional, preventing embedded deployment of ORB-SLAM3 systems.

## Key Features

- **Visualization-Free**: Complete removal of Pangolin and OpenCV display dependencies
- **Cross-Platform**: Ready for ARM Cortex-A53 and FPGA deployment
- **Production-Tested**: Validated on embedded hardware platforms
- **PetaLinux Compatible**: Designed for embedded Linux deployment
- **Drop-in Replacement**: Maintains full ORB-SLAM3 functionality without GUI components
- **Lightweight**: Optimized for resource-constrained embedded systems

## Target Platforms

### Embedded Systems
- ARM Cortex-A53 processors
- Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC
- Embedded Linux systems
- PetaLinux deployments

### Development Platforms  
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Cross-compilation environments
- Docker containers for embedded development
